# Follow Along as I learn RL
#### As I go through a Reinforcement Learning Course (https://www.udemy.com/course/practical-ai-with-python-and-reinforcement-learning/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) and read the book Deep Reinfocement Learning In Action (See forked repository) I will put my work here, whether it is a silly file exploring an environment or my solutions to a problem. Both the book and the course use Farama's Gymnasium (https://gymnasium.farama.org/) for beginning environments
